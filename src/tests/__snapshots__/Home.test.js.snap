        As you might be able to tell, I love drawing, even if I'm not that good at it. Here you can see a Turing machine, AlphaGo, Albert Einstein, some DNA, and Rosalind Franklin. Franklin is particularly underappreciated - she was not recognized for a Nobel prize only because she had passed away by the time it was awarded.
